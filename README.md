# Music NFT Platform with Streaming Royalties

## Project Description

The Music NFT Platform with Streaming Royalties is a revolutionary blockchain-based solution that transforms how musicians monetize their content and how listeners engage with music. This platform allows artists to mint their music tracks as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) while implementing a fair and transparent royalty distribution system based on streaming activity.

Unlike traditional music platforms where artists receive minimal compensation, our platform ensures that creators earn direct royalties every time their music is streamed. The smart contract automatically handles royalty calculations, distribution, and payments without intermediaries, creating a more equitable ecosystem for music creators and consumers.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize the music industry by creating a decentralized platform where:

- **Artists maintain full ownership** of their creative works through blockchain technology
- **Fair compensation** is guaranteed through automated royalty distribution
- **Transparent transactions** ensure artists know exactly how much they earn from each stream
- **Global accessibility** allows artists worldwide to monetize their music without geographical barriers
- **Community-driven ecosystem** where fans directly support their favorite artists

We aim to eliminate the traditional gatekeepers of the music industry and create a direct relationship between artists and their audience, powered by blockchain technology and smart contracts.
